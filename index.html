    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p id="bio">My name is Jaiden Silva. I was born on June 6, 2007 and live in Ringoes, NJ. I grew up watching movies and TV shows like Star wars, ATLA and Marvel and reading books like Harry Potter. During the summer of 2020, I started to make stuff I see from movies and books from just cardboard. I also make original ideas of mine as well. To make it even cooler, I incorporate circuits like Arduino into some of them. I start off making a sketch or making a 3d model of it. Then I do the circuit if any. After all that, I get the carboard out and make the project. It's something that I love doing and I'm passionate about.</p>
    <p> You can see my creations here: <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/frsd.us/jrs-works">JRS Works</a></p>
    <p>In this website, I will put blog posts on the new creations I have planned and are in progress. Right now, I'm working on a Boba fett suit. I plan to finish it before <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> final episode comes out, but we'll see how how it goes.</p>
